msgid "The second approach uses an artificial intelligence engine based on `this model <https://expertphotography.com/aesthetic-photography/>`_ to predict an aesthetic score. As deep-learning is an end-to-end solution, it doesn’t require hyper-parameter settings, which makes this approach far easier to use."
