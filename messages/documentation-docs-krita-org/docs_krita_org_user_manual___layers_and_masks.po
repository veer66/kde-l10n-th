msgid "Think of an artwork or collage made with various stacks of papers with some papers cut such that they show the paper beneath them while some hide what's beneath them. If you want to replace an element in the artwork, you replace that piece of paper instead of drawing the entire thing. In Krita instead of papers we use :dfn:`Layers`. Layers are part of the document which may or may not be transparent, they may be smaller or bigger than the document itself, they can arrange one above other, named and grouped."

If the pass through mode is activated by pressing the icon similar to bricked wall, the layers within the group are considered as if they are outside that particular group in the layer stack, however, the visibility of the layers in a group depends on the visibility of the group."

#: ../../user_manual/layers_and_masks.rst:89
msgid "It can be somewhat hard to figure out how the :dfn:`inherit alpha` feature works in Krita for the first time. Once you click on the inherit alpha icon on the layer stack, the pixels of the layer you are painting on are confined to the combined pixel area of all the layers below it. That means if you have the default white background layer as first layer, clicking on the inherit alpha icon and painting on any layer above will seem to have no effect as the entire canvas is filled with white. Hence, it is advised to put the base layer that you want the pixels to clip in a group layer. As mentioned above, group layers are composited separately, hence the layer which is the lowest layer in a group becomes the bounding layer and the content of the layers above this layer clips to it if inherit alpha is enabled."

Non-destructive editing means editing or changing a layer or image without actually changing the original source image permanently, the changes are just added as filters or masks over the original image while keeping it intact, this helps a lot when your workflow requires constant back and forth. You can go back to original image with a click of a button. Just hide the filter or mask you have your initial image."
