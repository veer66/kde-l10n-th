Krita is specialized in :dfn:`frame by frame animation`, and because of this Krita keeps all the frames in memory. This means that animation files will eat up all of your computer's working memory (RAM). If you don't know what working memory is, you probably have too little to do a long sequence in Krita. Therefore, you need to take a page from professional animation and do some planning!"

#: ../../user_manual/animation.rst:51
msgid "Typically, most animation projects start with a script or at the very least an outline of actions that will happen. You can do this in any kind of text editor you like. The next step is to create a :ref:`storyboard <storyboard_docker>`. They are sketches of the basic composition of each scene, with some extra notes on what is going to move, like camera movement, character movement, notes on audio, notes on color. These seem closer to a comic than an animation, but the key difference between the two is that in comics the composition is made to help the reader move their eyes over the page, while in animation the viewer's eyes will stay in relatively the same spot, so consecutive storyboard frames will have their most important elements in relatively the same place. If that seems a little abstract, don't worry. You can make a story board by using the animation functions, but the key here is that you use as little frames as possible. Export the story board using the render animation option."

msgid "Doing the animatic will allow you to see how the animation can be subdivided into small clips. If you are just starting out, you are best off limiting yourself to 12 frames per second. Then, a 10-second clip would be 120 frames. Try to figure out if you can subdivide your animation idea into clips of 10 seconds or shorter. You can import the story board frames associated with a specific clip by going to :menuselection:`File --> Import Animation Frames`. From there, slowly start building up your animation. During the sketching phase it may also help to work on a low resolution, like 800×450 pixels. High resolution only starts mattering when you are doing line art, after all. And it will be hard to get to that point if you don't even have a rough outline."

This way, if the animation file gets corrupt, which could happen due to a power outage, or a cat jumping on the keyboard, you will still have a snapshot of the last important section.
