msgid "Instant Preview (previously known under the code name Level Of Detail/LOD strokes) is Krita's special speed-up mechanism that was funded by the 2015 Kickstarter. Krita slows down with really large images due to the large amount of data it's crunching in painting these images. Instant Preview works by taking a smaller version of the canvas, and drawing the feedback on there while Krita calculates the real stroke in the background. This means that if you have a 4k screen and are working on a 4k image at 100% zoom, you won't feel any speed up."
