msgid "On one hand, this makes vector graphics great for logos and banners. On the other hand, raster graphics are much easier to edit, so vectors tend to be the domain of deliberate design, using a lot of precision."

msgid "You can start making vector graphics by first making a vector layer (press the arrow button next to the :guilabel:`+` in the layer docker to get extra layer types). Then, all the usual drawing tools outside the Freehand, Dynamic and the Multibrush tool can be used to draw shapes."
