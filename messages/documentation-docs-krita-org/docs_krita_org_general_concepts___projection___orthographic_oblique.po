msgid "I always start with the side, and then extrapolate the front view from it. Because you are using Krita, set up two parallel rulers, one vertical and the other horizontal. To snap them perfectly, drag one of the nodes after you have made the ruler, and press the :kbd:`Shift` key to snap it horizontal or vertical. In 3.0, you can also snap them to the image borders if you have :menuselection:`Snap Image Bounds` active via the :kbd:`Shift + S` shortcut."

msgid "If you want to do precision position moving in the tool options docker, just select 'position' and the input box for the X. Pressing down then moves the transformed selection left. With Krita 3.0 you can just use the move tool for this and the arrow keys. Using transform here can be more convenient if you also have to squash and stretch an eye."
