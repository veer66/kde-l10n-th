msgid "Sure, caustics, it’s not like it’s the most complicated effect known to CG graphics… Okay, so the first thing is that light effects never work in isolation: you need to be spot on with colors and other effects to make it work. So we first need to recreate the surroundings a bit."

msgid "Note how the smudge brush here is used not just to mix areas, but also to create definition of borders by lowering the scatter. (If you reverse the pressure curve on the scatter, this’ll be easily done by increasing the pressure on the stylus)"

msgid "Make sure to try and follow the shapes you made. (*I failed at this*) The great thing about the sketch brush is that it causes those little ‘melt-togethers’ where two lines cross. This is only per stroke, so make a lot of long ongoing strokes with this brush to make use of it."
