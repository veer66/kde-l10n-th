msgid "Kdenlive is a community project which aims to deliver a free and open source video editing software application to allow everybody to produce high quality content in order to increase the democratization of the media. The application has a graphical user interface written in C++ with [Qt][8] and uses KDE libraries for the [MLT framework][6] written by Dan Dennedy, which relies on [FFmpeg][7] to decode and encode almost all the video and audio formats that are available today, and which hosts effects libraries like Frei0r and Movit for video, and LADSPA and SOX for audio."

"# Let’s do More!\n"
"\n"
"First goal reached: With the 15.000 € you have already generously donated we can take on implementing nested timelines, improved effects workflow, stabilize the code and boost performance.\n"
"\n"
"Now it is time to set some stretch goals.\n"
"\n"
"Based on feedback you have given us, we have set the following stretch goals for our fundraiser: when we reach 20.000 €, we will be able to take on making keyframing more powerful by adding new easing types and curves. If we reach 25.000 €, we will be able to improve support for videos with alpha, as well as for media with a greater variety of resolutions.\n"
"\n"
"Our aim is to make Kdenlive the most useful and feature-rich video editor, while at the same time keeping it free and open for everyone.\n"

"# Performance Boost\n"
"\n"
"Your donation will help us overhaul the code and improve Kdenlive’s general responsiveness. An in depth (and time-consuming) refactorization will help make Kdenlive snappier and more pleasurable to use overall.\n"
"\n"
"We will be able to improve video and audio playback on the timeline, both at normal and slow speeds. This will help you when reviewing and tweaking clips, cuts, effects and transitions, making these tasks much easier, less prone to errors and more fluid.\n"
"\n"
"Supporting us will also contribute to the harmonization of the rendering pipeline, which will positively affect proxy clips and timeline previews, as well as the final rendering of your work, making the encoding, previews and renders of your project faster, stabler and more reliable.\n"

"# Nested Timelines\n"
"\n"
"The nested timeline feature will allow you to open several timeline tabs. Each tab contains a separate timeline, all of them share the same project bin and will be saved inside the same project file. You will then be able to insert (or “nest”) one timeline within another, and it will act as a single clip. However, changing a sequence in a nested timeline will automatically update it in the container timelines. You might want to integrate, for example, a complex “Final credits” compositing sequence with 10 tracks at the end of your project. You could do this in a timeline tab and then insert that timeline as a single clip into your main project, allowing for a much cleaner workflow.\n"

"# Efficient Effects Workflow\n"
"\n"
"Currently, if you want to tweak some basic parameters like the brightness or contrast of a clip, you need to go through several steps: First, you have to search through the effects list to find the one you need. Then you have to add it to the clip itself, and, finally, you have to adjust the parameters.\n"
"\n"
"This is quite cumbersome for what is simple, everyday adjustments. To make your workflow much more fluid, we will introduce a new effects panel that gives you direct access to these parameters, allowing you to quickly and easily adjust levels, crop, transform and, for audio clips, volume, and pan.\n"

You can also see the recent additions to the application. There are now four layout buttons (marked 1-4) in the toolbar, which can be used to set up different screen layouts to be recalled instantly. This allows you to, for example, set up your screen into different \"modes\" of operation, such as for applying effects (which is still TO BE DONE\"), straight editing, compositing, playback, or any other way that you wish to set them up. Modes are not forced upon the user, however - you are quite welcome to have everything onscreen at the same time if you so desire!"
