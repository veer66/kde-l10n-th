msgid "While apps using KDE frameworks, like Kate or Dolphin, can talk directly to network protocols such as Windows' SMB or SSH, other apps like LibreOffice cannot. Instead, KDE used to make local copies of remote files that were then copied back and forth between the servers and the desktop. This proved to be unreliable and could lead to the data loss. Now, using KIO Fuse, all apps will be able to talk to remote files as if they were local, removing the problems of making a temporary copies."
