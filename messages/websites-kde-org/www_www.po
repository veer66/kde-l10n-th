We find this transformation incomprehensible, moreover when NGI has proven efficient and economical to support free software as a whole, from the smallest to the most established initiatives. This ecosystem diversity backs the strength of European technological innovation, and maintaining the NGI initiative to provide structural support to software projects at the heart of worldwide innovation is key to enforce the sovereignty of a European infrastructure. Contrary to common perception, technical innovations often originate from European rather than North American programming communities, and are mostly initiated by small-scaled organizations."

Hover your cursor over a file and it will show you a small preview. Do the same over a folder and it will show you pictures from the files it contains. New in KDE Gear 21.08 is that, if a folder contains a lot of previewable files, it will show you an animated sequence of previews so you can check to see if the folder contains what you are looking for. Dolphin also shows previews for files inside encrypted locations, such as Plasma Vaults. Dolphin's preview code has also been optimized in this version and thumbnails now pop up faster."

In Dolphin 21.08, this information now updates in real-time. This means that, if the file is changed by another app, the _Information Panel_ will show you the changes immediately."

You use motion tracking if you want an element to follow something else that is moving around in the frame. Say you want to blur out a child's face, but they are moving around, or you want a label with text to follow a character as they walk across the frame. Locate _Motion Tracker_ in the list effects and drag and drop it into the clip you want to track.

Next, select both clips (hold down the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key and click on one clip, and then, still holding down <kbd>Shift</kbd>, click on the other); hit the <kbd>u</kbd> key and... Hey presto!

Plasma 5 is intended for end users, but will not provide feature parity with the latest 4.x release, which will come in follow-up version. The team is concentrating on the core desktop features first, instead of trying to transplant every single feature into the new workspaces. The feature set presented in Plasma 5.0 will suffice for most users, though some might miss a button here and there.

Moreover, rearranging windows in group popups is now possible, allowing the user to make the ordering of his opened applications more predictable.

We have spent the last four months optimising startup and minimising memory usage, yielding faster time-to-desktop, better runtime performance and less memory consumption. Basic features like panel popups were optimised to make sure they run smoothly even on the lowest-end hardware.

X11 windows can connect to this server as if it were a normal X server, for KWin it looks like a Wayland window, though.

A related improvement is that the look of the calendar that pops up when you click on the clock has been overhauled, and is now more functional and gives you more information in the same space, while at the same time making it easier on the eyes."

Speaking of which, from Plasma 5.22 onwards, KWin supports variable refresh rate/FreeSync screens on Wayland. This means that if you have more than one screen and each of them has a different refresh rate, you can configure each one individually so video playback and games will look perfect regardless of which one they are displayed on."

This is useful if you want to play a movie on a TV, for example."

You can now maximize windows vertically and/or horizontally. You can plug in an external graphics card and KWin will pick it up and configure it on the fly--no need to restart Plasma. And performance is now improved thanks to supporting direct scan-out for full-screen windows (only on non-NVIDIA GPUs for now). The increase in performance happens because KWin now avoids unnecessary copies of the screen contents when there is a game or application running full-screen. By not having to copy the screen over and over, playback runs faster."

This gives you more to pick from when copying, while at the same time decluttering the list by removing snippets you may have accidentally or absentmindedly highlighted while working with Plasma. To further help you keep things tidy, you can also remove selected items from the clipboard's popup by pressing the [Delete] key on the keyboard.

The currently supported feature set is driven by the needs for the <a href=\"https://dot.kde.org/2015/07/25/plasma-mobile-free-mobile-platform\"> Plasma Mobile project</a> and more desktop oriented features are not yet fully implemented. The current state does not yet allow to use it as a replacement for Xorg based desktop, but allows to easily test it, contribute and watch tear free videos. Instructions on how to start Plasma on Wayland can be found in the <a href='https://community.kde.org/KWin/Wayland#Start_a_Plasma_session_on_Wayland'>KWin wiki pages</a>.

msgid "With Plasma 5.5 a basic Wayland session is provided. Wayland is the successor of the dated X11 windowing system providing a modern approach. The system is more secure (e.g. key loggers are no longer trivial to implement) and follows the paradigm of 'every frame perfect' which makes screen tearing very difficult. With Plasma 5.4 the KDE community already provided a technology preview based on the feature set of the Phone project. With Plasma 5.5 this is now extended with more 'desktop style' usages. Important features like move/resize of windows is now supported as well as many integration features for the desktop shell. This allows for usage by early adopters, though we need to point out that it is not yet up to the task of fully replacing an X session. We encourage our more technical users to give it a try and report as many bugs as you can find."
